# Fixing Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Integration

## Problem
The error message indicates that Tailwind CSS v4 has moved its PostCSS plugin to a separate package:

```
It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

## Solution Implemented

Since the `@tailwindcss/postcss` package doesn't appear to be available in npm yet (as of May 2024), we've implemented a temporary solution by downgrading to Tailwind CSS v3.4.1, which doesn't require a separate PostCSS plugin.

### Changes made:
1. Downgraded Tailwind CSS from v4.0.12 to v3.4.1 in package.json
2. Updated postcss.config.js to use the standard configuration with autoprefixer

```javascript
/** @type {import('postcss-load-config').Config} */
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

### Required Steps to Apply Changes:

To ensure that the downgraded version of Tailwind CSS is properly installed and used:

1. **Clean the npm cache:**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Remove node_modules and package-lock.json:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Alternative Future Solutions

When the `@tailwindcss/postcss` package becomes available, you can revert to using Tailwind CSS v4 with the following steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS v4 and its PostCSS plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss@4 @tailwindcss/postcss --save-dev
   ```

2. Update your PostCSS configuration (postcss.config.js):
   ```javascript
   /** @type {import('postcss-load-config').Config} */
   export default {
     plugins: {
       '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   };
   ```
