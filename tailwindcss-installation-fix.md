# Fix for TailwindCSS Module Not Found Error

## Problem
The application is failing to start with the following error:
```
Failed to load PostCSS config: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
```

## Root Cause
Although `tailwindcss` is properly listed as a dev dependency in your package.json, the Node modules don't appear to be properly installed or accessible in your environment.

## Solution

Please try these steps in order:

1. **Reinstall dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you're using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
   or if you're using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work, try installing tailwindcss explicitly**
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
   ```
   
3. **Check for Node.js version issues**
   Make sure your Node.js version is compatible with the dependencies. Try:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   If your Node version is too old, consider updating it.

4. **Check for path or permissions issues**
   Make sure the node_modules folder exists and has proper permissions.

5. **Try clearing npm cache**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

After trying these steps, run your development server again:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The error indicates that while your configuration files are set up correctly, the actual module isn't being found at runtime. This is typically a dependency installation issue rather than a code problem.
